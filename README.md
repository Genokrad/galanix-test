for starting project in 2 and 3 task use "npm run dev".

//////////!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!//////////////////
Everything is implemented except for the last point 7 in the 3rd task (I didn't have enough time for testing, and I didn't want to send it with a potential error in the application).

What I would like to implement, but did not have time:
Use the formk biblio library for form validation,
Use an api that will add countries, I know the necessary api, but did not have time to implement.
